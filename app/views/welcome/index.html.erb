<h3>A Brief Drag Queen History</h3>
</br>
<p>The origin of the term drag is uncertain. The first recorded use of drag in reference to actors dressed in women's clothing is from 1870. 
For much of history, drag queens were men, but in more modern times, cisgender and trans women, as well as non-binary people, also perform as drag queens. 
In a 2018 article, Psychology Today stated that drag queens are "most typically gay cisgender men (though there are many drag queens of varying sexual orientations and gender identities)".
Examples of trans female drag queens, sometimes called trans queens, include Monica Beverly Hillz and Peppermint. Cisgender female drag queens are sometimes 
called faux queens or bioqueens, though both terms are problematic: faux carries the connotation that the drag is fake, and the use of bioqueen exclusively for cisgender 
females is a misnomer since trans female queens also have female bodies. Drag queens' counterparts are drag kings: performers, usually women, who dress in exaggeratedly masculine clothing. 
Trans men who dress like drag kings are sometimes termed trans kings.</p>
